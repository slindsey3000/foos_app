# Cursor Rules for USA Foosball Project

## File Editing Guidelines
- "When editing files, always open and modify them directly. Never suggest or run sed, awk, or shell-based file edits."

## Asset Management
- "When altering CSS, JavaScript, or other asset files that should trigger asset precompilation, offer the user the option to run the precompile_assets.sh script to clean and rebuild assets."
